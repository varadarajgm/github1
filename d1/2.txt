difference b/w hard link and soft link
  hard link ---it shows the mirror content or data stored inside the original file 
  soft link --- it doesnot shows the mirror content
hard link---it shows same inode as the original in mirror
soft link-- it has diff inode number
hard link-- it cannot used for linking directory
soft link-- it can be used for linking direc
hard link ---if we delete some data in mirror image the data will remain the same why bcz it is directly connected to hard link
soft link ----data will get deleted bcz soft link is not connected to the kernel
